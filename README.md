# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ States Game

This program is an educational game that tests knowledge about the states of the United States of America.

## Usage

You can download the project and run the main file as long as you have Python installed. You just have to try to guess the name of the next state until you don't know anymore.

The "Exit" keyword will exit the game and generate a file in the game folder called user_report.csv containing all unguessed states.
